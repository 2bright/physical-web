##The Physical Web
The Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core super power of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device: e.g. a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car, and not have to download an app first in order to use it. The user experience of using smart devices should be much like we use links on web, just tap and use.

The Physical Web is, at its base, a discovery service where URLs are broadcast and any nearby device can receive them. This takes the web we know and love and unlocks exciting new ways to interact. 

The URL is the fundamental building block of the web, giving remarkable flexibility of expression. It can be:

* a web page with just a tiny paragraph of info
* a fully interactive web page
* a deep link into a native application.  

##Why We're Doing This
The number of smart devices is going to explode, both in our homes and in public spaces. Much like the web, there is going to be a 'long tail' of interactivity for smart devices. But the overhead of installing an app for each one just doesn't  scale. We need a system that lets someone walk up and use a device with just a tap. The Physical web isn't about replacing native apps, it's about allowing interaction for the times when native apps just aren't practical.

##Open Design
The Physical Web must be an open standard that everyone can use. This can't be a product that is locked down by a single company. Like many web specifications, this is an open source design that is being released early so everyone can experiment and comment on it. There is much to discuss and add to this specification.
